# Project Structure

This repository contains work from multiple sprints organized into two main folders:

## üìÅ Folder Organization

### `RWM_P0_C00194821/`
Contains **Sprints 1-5** (up to Section 2 of Sprint 5)
- Sprint 1: Initial Git setup and basic workflows
- Sprint 2: Branching and merging fundamentals
- Sprint 3: Collaboration workflows
- Sprint 4: Advanced Git operations
- Sprint 5 (Sections 0-2): Merge conflict setup and basic exercises

### `svelte-merge-conflicts/`
Contains **Sprint 5 continuation** (Section 3 onwards)
- Section 3: SvelteKit three-way merge exercise
- Realistic component-based merge conflict resolution
- Advanced merge scenarios with `.svelte` files

## üîÑ Sprint 5 Split Explanation

Sprint 5 is divided across both folders due to its dual nature:
- **Basic merge conflicts** (text files, simple Git operations) ‚Üí Main project folder
- **SvelteKit-specific conflicts** (component merging, framework-specific scenarios) ‚Üí Separate SvelteKit project

This separation allows for:
- Clean isolation of the SvelteKit environment
- Proper package management for the web framework
- Realistic simulation of merge conflicts in a modern development setup
